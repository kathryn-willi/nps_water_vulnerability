#' this function calculates aquifer volume for a given depth to water (dtw) 
#' assuming the aquifer takes the form of a triangular shaped prism, i.e., 
#' an alluvial or valley aquifer. 
#' Inputs:
#' @param dtw_ft The depth to groundwater in feet
#' @param aquifer_extent sf_shapefile of the aquifer extent when full 
#' @param full_thickness_ft Thickness of the deepest part of the aquifer
#' @param well_depth The default is to assume the well penetrates the aquifer,
#' i.e., well_depth == full_thickness_ft. However, if the well is less than
#' fully penetrating, the total depth can be added here.
#' @param valley_wall_elev Elevation change between the valley wall and location
#'                          of wells which DTW is measured from.
#' @param theta_deg The angle between the aquifer ground surface and the plung-
#' ing aquifer sides  
#' @param sy specific yield of the aquifer
#' 
#' Returns:
#' @param water_volume The volume of water in the aquifer in cubic feet
